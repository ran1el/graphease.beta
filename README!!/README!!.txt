To run the Application, you'll need to install the following Python packages:
Streamlit – for creating the app interface.
Plotly – for generating interactive plots.
Pandas – for handling the data (CSV or Excel files).

You can install them via GitBash(pip) with the following commands:
pip install streamlit
pip install plotly 
pip install pandas

Also, for reading Excel files, you might need openpyxl or xlrd, depending on your file type:
pip install openpyxl  # For reading `.xlsx` files
pip install xlrd      # For older `.xls` files 

After that, you should be able to run the code successfully!
